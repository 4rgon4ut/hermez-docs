# Polygon Hermez Docs

Welcome to the documentation site of the Polygon Hermez project.

Polygon Hermez is a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution based on cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to provide validation and fast finality to off-chain transactions computation, a zk-rollup.

After the launch of Hermez 1.0 in March 2021 designed to support Ethereum token transfers, the team is currently working on the development of Hermez 2.0, the zkEVM or Ethereum complete emulation in a zero-knowledge virtual machine. This is a challenging design decision but the objective is to minimize the user friction to use this scalability solution and boost the utility of the Ethereum network.

The team is designing and implementing a revolutionary approach that will recreate all the EVM opcodes for transparent deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts. For this purpose a new set of technologies and tools are being created and engineered.
